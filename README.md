# Portfolio

# **Project Description**: 
This is my personal portfolio showing my previous works. Except for the projects done in Communications Lab, I also include the projects done in other IM courses as well as my personal interests. I want my portfolio to be as concise and clean as possible, so I design the website to be only black and white and grey, also there isn't much gaudy stuffs in the website.

# **Process**: 

**Home Page**
I want to make all the page with only black, white and grey. So for the section background I choose to use is a dotted background. The navigation bar also uses css animation, when hovering over the section name, it will turn grey and a border will appear. What I like the most is the boucing effect of the cursor indicating audiences to click and scroll to move to the following sections.

**MY WORKS**
This section is for placing projects for Communications Lab and this section uses mainly css animation. When the mouse hovers over the poster of each project, a grey box will flow up and the short brief appears. With mouse putting on the introduction, the font will change to lead the audiences to click. Once clicked, a small window will pop up at the center. And clicking the picture will lead to the project itself, and clicking the introduction will lead to the documentation of the project. With the size of window shrinks, the popup window will change it layout accordingly to provide a better view.

**MORE ABOUT ME**
This page uses css hover to do the interactions, I apply 3-D visual effect to the text on the picture. When hovering over the picture, it will turn to the back of the picture, showing the simple introduction of th project. Clicking the picture will lead to the video of project directly.

**CONTECT ME**
Here I want to develop a area that for audience to contact me, I choose the left and right layout, with smaller size of the website, it will change to up and down layout.

# **Reflection/Evaluation**: 

To develop in the future, I want to connect it with a online database so that I can really receive opinions from others. The simple design shows that I want to show the identity of preciseness and self-consistent. Basically the portfolio develops based on the css animation, and I like it very much!
